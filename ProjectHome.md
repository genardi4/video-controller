So what is Video Controller?

---

  * Play and Pause your opened YouTube videos without ever leaving your current tab.
  * Playlists made simple! With simple Next and Previous buttons you can control YouTube as if it was iTunes.
  * Video Controller works with every tab in every window - no matter where that video is hiding!
  * Change volume level or mute the video entirely.
  * Restart the video and play it from the beginning.
  * if no videos are open - Video Controller will link you automatically to YouTube so you won’t have to bother!
  * Whenever you like you can always bring up your YouTube window with a click - and control it from there - Although we promise you won’t have to! :)
